# Introduction

Welcome to the Mood user guide! This documentation will help you, as an administrator, to use the platform effectively to gather anonymous feedback from your teams.

## What is Mood?

Mood is a simple yet powerful tool designed with one core principle: **honest feedback requires true anonymity**. It allows you to create polling "campaigns" and distribute unique links to different teams or managers.

Each person can then vote on their mood and leave an optional comment without needing to log in or provide any personal information. As an administrator, you get a clear overview of team morale while ensuring complete privacy for your members.

## Key Concepts

- **Campaigns**: A campaign is the main event for your poll. For example, "Q4 Satisfaction Check" or "Post-Project Feedback". It acts as a container for all related votes.
- **Poll Links**: Instead of one link for everyone, you generate multiple unique links for each campaign. You can assign a link to a specific manager or team (e.g., "Design Team", "John Doe's Squad"). This allows you to see results segmented by team, without ever knowing who voted.
- **Dashboard**: The central place where you can create new campaigns, view active ones, check participation rates, and analyze the results.

This guide will walk you through setting up your account, creating your first campaign, and understanding the results dashboard.
