# Managing Campaigns

Once you have created one or more campaigns, the "Active Campaigns" page becomes your central hub for monitoring and management.

## Accessing the Management Page

From the main administrator dashboard, click on the **"Active Campaigns"** card.

## The Campaigns Table

You will see a table listing all your campaigns. By default, it shows only active (unarchived) campaigns. The table provides the following information at a glance:

- **Name**: The name of the campaign.
- **Links**: The total number of unique poll links generated for this campaign.
- **Votes**: The total number of votes received for this campaign so far.
- **Date**: The creation date of the campaign.
- **Participation**: A progress bar showing the percentage of links that have received at least one vote.

### Viewing Archived Campaigns

To view campaigns that you have previously archived, simply toggle the **"Show Archived"** switch at the top right of the page. The table will update to show only the archived campaigns, and the action menu will change accordingly.

## Campaign Actions

For each campaign in the table, there is an **"Actions"** dropdown menu on the far right. This menu provides all the management options for that specific campaign.

### 1. Manage Links

- **Action**: "Manage Links"
- **What it does**: Opens a dialog window that lists all the poll links associated with that campaign.
- **Features**:
  - **Copy Link**: You can copy any individual link to your clipboard using the copy icon.
  - **Add Manager**: Click the **"Add Manager"** button at the bottom of the dialog. A new dialog will appear, allowing you to enter the name of a new manager. A new unique link will be generated for them and added to the list.

### 2. Archive / Restore

- **Action**: "Archive" or "Restore"
- **What it does**: This action changes depending on whether you are viewing active or archived campaigns.
  - **Archive**: For an active campaign, this will move it to the archive. It will no longer be visible in the default view.
  - **Restore**: For an archived campaign (when "Show Archived" is on), this will make it active again.

### 3. View Results

- **Action**: "View Results"
- **What it does**: This is a shortcut that takes you directly to the "Global Results" page, with the filter already set to show only the results for that specific campaign.
