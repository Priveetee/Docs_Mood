# Creating a Campaign

Creating a campaign is the primary way to start gathering feedback. This guide covers the process from start to finish.

## Accessing the Creation Page

From the main administrator dashboard, click on the **"New Campaign"** card to navigate to the creation page.

## Step 1: Fill in Campaign Details

You will be presented with a form to configure your new campaign.

1.  **Campaign Name**: Enter a clear and descriptive name for your campaign (e.g., "End of Year Feedback", "Sprint 23 Retrospective"). This name will be visible to you in the dashboard and to users on the poll page.

2.  **Add Managers**: This is where you list the teams or managers for whom you want to generate unique poll links.
    - Type a manager's name (or a team name) into the input field.
    - Click the **"+"** button or press **Enter**.
    - The name will appear as a badge below the input. You can remove a manager by clicking the "x" on their badge.
    - You must add at least one manager to proceed.

3.  **Expiration Date (Optional)**:
    - Click on the calendar button to open a date picker.
    - Select a future date on which you want the campaign to automatically close. After this date, no new votes will be accepted.
    - If you do not set a date, the campaign will remain open indefinitely until you manually archive it.

## Step 2: Generate Links

Once you have provided a name and added at least one manager, the **"Generate Links"** button will become active.

- Click this button to create the campaign and generate a unique, anonymous poll link for each manager you added.

## Step 3: Distribute the Links

After generation, the view will switch to a results screen displaying the newly created links.

- **Link List**: You will see a list of each manager and their corresponding unique URL.
- **Copy Individual Link**: Use the copy icon next to each link to copy it individually.
- **Copy All**: Click the **"Copy All"** button to copy the entire list of managers and their links to your clipboard, ready to be pasted into an email or document.
- **Send by Email**: Click the **"Send by Email"** button. This will open your default email client with a pre-filled draft containing the campaign name and the list of all generated links, ready for you to send.

You can now distribute these links to the appropriate people. Once votes start coming in, you can track them by managing the campaign or analyzing the results.
