# Analyzing Results

The "Global Results" page is a powerful interactive dashboard that lets you explore the feedback you've received.

## Accessing the Results Page

From the main administrator dashboard, click on the **"Global Results"** card.

## Filtering Your Data

At the top of the page, you'll find two filter bars to refine the data you are viewing.

### Primary Filters

- **Campaign Filter**: A dropdown menu to select a specific campaign. By default, it shows "All Campaigns". When you select a campaign, the Manager Filter will update to show only managers from that campaign.
- **Manager Filter**: A dropdown menu to filter results for a specific manager or team. By default, it shows "All Managers".

### Date Period Filter

Below the primary filters, you can select a time range for the data:

- **7 days**, **30 days**, **3 months**, **Current Year**, or **All**.
- The default view is "Current Year". The data on the dashboard will automatically update when you select a new period.

## Understanding the Dashboard

The dashboard is composed of several interactive widgets that give you a comprehensive view of your team's mood.

### 1. Mood Distribution Chart

- **What it is**: A pie chart showing the percentage of each mood (Très bien, Neutre, etc.) for the selected filters.
- **Interactivity**: Hover your mouse over a section of the chart. The background of the entire page will smoothly transition to the color of that mood, providing a dynamic visual experience.

### 2. Latest Comments

- **What it is**: A scrollable list of all the comments left by users, corresponding to the current filter selection.
- **Details**: Each comment is anonymous but shows which manager/team the feedback came from, along with a color-coded dot indicating the mood associated with the comment.

### 3. Key Statistics Cards

Below the chart and comments, two cards highlight the most important metrics:

- **Total Votes**: The total number of votes received for the current selection.
- **Dominant Mood**: The mood that has received the most votes.
- **Interactivity**: Hover your mouse over the "Dominant Mood" card. The page background will change to the color of that mood, just like with the chart.

## Exporting Data

You can export the filtered data at any time.

- Click the **"Export (CSV)"** button located in the main filter bar.
- A CSV file will be downloaded to your computer.
- The file name will be automatically generated based on the selected campaign and the current date (e.g., `resultats_Sprint-23_2025-11-03_15-00.csv`).
- This file contains a detailed breakdown of all votes in the current selection, including date, campaign, manager, mood, and the full text of the comment.
